 == The Peculiar Banana ==
A Short Story
by John Doe

Annie Platt was thinking about Roger Blacksmith again. Roger was a stingy gamer with fluffy eyes and tall toes.

Annie walked over to the window and reflected on her creepy surroundings. She had always hated beautiful Western University with its grisly, grubby geese. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel unstable.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a stingy figure of Roger Blacksmith.

Annie gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a grateful, smelly, wine drinker with ruddy eyes and blonde toes. Her friends saw her as an alive, annoyed academic. Once, she had even revived a dying, baby bird.

But not even a grateful person who had once revived a dying, baby bird, was prepared for what Roger had in store today.

The moon shone like drinking foxes, making Annie stressed. Annie grabbed a peculiar banana that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.

As Annie stepped outside and Roger came closer, she could see the fresh glint in his eye.

"I am here because I want internet access," Roger bellowed, in an arrogant tone. He slammed his fist against Annie's chest, with the force of 6719 frogs. "I frigging hate you, Annie Platt."

Annie looked back, even more stressed and still fingering the peculiar banana. "Roger, hands up or I'll shoot," she replied.

They looked at each other with irritable feelings, like two careful, crazy cats shouting at a very malicious dinner party, which had indie music playing in the background and two deranged uncles thinking to the beat.

Suddenly, Roger lunged forward and tried to punch Annie in the face. Quickly, Annie grabbed the peculiar banana and brought it down on Roger's skull.

Roger's fluffy eyes trembled and his tall toes wobbled. He looked puzzled, his body raw like a noisy, numerous newspaper.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Roger Blacksmith was dead.

Annie Platt went back inside and made herself a nice glass of wine.

THE END
